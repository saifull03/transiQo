# 🚗 RideBuzz (RideX) - Full-Stack MERN Ride-Sharing Platform

**RideBuzz** is a modern, production-ready ride-sharing web application built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) featuring real-time Socket.IO bi-directional communication, interactive Leaflet maps with OSRM routing, dynamic fare calculations, professional PDF receipt generation, and dedicated role-based dashboards for passengers and drivers.

## ✨ Key Features

### 👤 Passenger Workflow
- **Interactive Route Selection**: Click anywhere on the OpenStreetMap/Leaflet map to set Pickup and Dropoff locations.
- **Automatic OSRM Routing**: Instantly calculates driving polyline, distance (km), and estimated travel time (min).
- **Dynamic Fare Calculation**: Transparent pricing model based on base fare, per-kilometer rate, and per-minute duration.
- **Real-Time Driver Tracking**: View driver details (name, phone, star rating, vehicle make/model, license plate) the moment a ride is accepted.
- **Live Trip Timer**: Displays active trip elapsed time during the journey.
- **Cash Payment & Rating System**: Complete cash payments and submit comprehensive 1-to-5 star reviews with comments.

### 🚕 Driver (Rider) Workflow
- **Persistent Online Status**: Toggle availability status ("Go Online" / "Go Offline") with automatic MongoDB persistence and local storage session synchronization across page refreshes.
- **Instant Ride Requests**: Receive real-time broadcasted ride opportunities with passenger details and pickup/dropoff addresses.
- **Full Trip Lifecycle Management**: Seamlessly transition rides through `accepted` ➔ `started` ➔ `completed` ➔ `cash collected`.
- **Earnings & Rating Dashboard**: Track total completed rides, accumulated cash earnings, and passenger review history.

### ⚡ Core Infrastructure
- **Real-Time Socket.IO Engine**: Instantaneous event-driven updates for ride requests, acceptance, trip initiation, completion, and payment confirmation.
- **Professional Receipt Export**: Dedicated receipt viewing modal with automated dynamic `document.title` synchronization (`Transiqo-invoice-[id]`) for professional PDF printing and downloading.
- **Robust State Synchronization**: Advanced React lifecycle management ensuring flawless map resets and clean dashboard transitions between active and completed rides.

## 🔌 Socket.IO Event Reference

| Event Name | Direction | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `join` | Client ➔ Server | Subscribes client to personal user room or general `"riders"` broadcast room. |
| `rideRequest` | Client ➔ Server | Passenger broadcasts new ride details and coordinates to all online drivers. |
| `newRideRequest` | Server ➔ Client | Server broadcasts incoming ride opportunity to available drivers. |
| `rideAccepted` | Bi-directional | Driver accepts ride; server routes driver/vehicle profile directly to passenger. |
| `removeRideRequest` | Server ➔ Client | Instructs all other online drivers to remove a newly claimed ride request. |
| `rideStarted` | Bi-directional | Driver initiates trip; passenger dashboard starts live elapsed timer. |
| `rideCompleted`| Bi-directional | Driver completes trip; passenger dashboard displays cash collection prompt. |
| `paymentConfirmed`| Bi-directional | Driver confirms cash receipt; passenger dashboard transitions to review modal. |
